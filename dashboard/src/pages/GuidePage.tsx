    title: "What is HomeSOC?",
    intro:
      "HomeSOC (Home Security Operations Center) is a self-hosted system that monitors the security of your local devices in real time. Think of it as a mini enterprise security platform — but designed for your home network.",
    content: [
      "HomeSOC watches what happens on your computers (macOS and Windows) by running lightweight **agents** that collect security-relevant events — things like processes being launched, network connections being made, files being created, and login attempts.",
      "Those events are sent to a central **backend server** running on your machine. The backend stores everything in a local database, runs **detection rules** to spot suspicious activity, and streams results to a live **dashboard** you can view in your browser.",
      "Everything runs locally on your network. No data leaves your home. There are no cloud dependencies, no subscriptions, and no third parties involved.",
      "The system is built with three main pieces:\n• **Agents** — Small Python programs that run on each device you want to monitor.\n• **Backend** — A FastAPI server that receives events, stores them, runs detections, and serves the dashboard API.\n• **Dashboard** — A React web app that shows you everything in real time.",
    ],
    faqs: [
      {
        q: "Do I need to be a security expert to use this?",
        a: "No. HomeSOC is designed to be approachable. The dashboard shows you plain-language information about what's happening. Detection rules are pre-configured to catch common suspicious patterns. You can learn as you go.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does HomeSOC send any data to the internet?",
        a: "No. Everything stays on your local network. The backend runs on your machine, agents communicate over your LAN, and the dashboard is served locally. No external servers are contacted.",
      },
      {
        q: "What devices can HomeSOC monitor?",
        a: "Currently macOS and Windows. The macOS agent uses Apple's Endpoint Security framework (eslogger) and network monitoring (lsof). The Windows agent uses the Windows Event Log, WMI, and netstat. Linux support can be added in the future.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is this a replacement for antivirus software?",
        a: "No. HomeSOC is a visibility and detection tool — it helps you see what's happening and flags suspicious patterns. It does not block or quarantine threats. Think of it as a security camera system, not a guard. You should still use antivirus/EDR software alongside it.",

        q: "What do the severity colors mean?",
        a: "• Info (gray) — Normal activity, logged for visibility.\n• Low (blue) — Slightly unusual but probably harmless.\n• Medium (yellow) — Worth a look. Could be legitimate or suspicious.\n• High (red) — Likely suspicious. Investigate soon.\n• Critical (dark red) — Strongly indicates malicious or dangerous activity. Act immediately.",

      "**Expanding a row** — Click any event row to expand it. This reveals the full raw JSON data, which includes every field the agent collected. This is useful for deep investigation.",
      "**Filters** — Use the Category and Severity dropdowns at the top to narrow down what you're looking at. For example, filter to \"network\" + \"high\" to see only suspicious network connections.",
      "**Clear All** — The red trash button clears all events from the database. This is permanent and cannot be undone. A confirmation dialog will appear first (unless you disabled it in Settings).",

        q: "What are the event categories?",
        a: "• **Process** — A program was started, stopped, or signaled. Examples: bash launched, python executed, SIGKILL sent.\n• **Network** — A network connection was made or observed. Examples: curl connecting to an external IP, ssh session opened.\n• **File** — A file was created, opened, or renamed. Examples: new file in /tmp, .plist created in LaunchDaemons.\n• **Auth** — A login attempt occurred. Examples: password login succeeded, biometric authentication failed.\n• **Service** — A system service changed state.\n• **System** — General system-level events.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why do I see so many 'info' severity events?",
        a: "Most system activity is normal and harmless — that's info severity. HomeSOC logs it for visibility and forensic context. The important events are medium, high, and critical. Use the severity filter to focus on those if the volume is overwhelming.",
      },
      {
        q: "What does 'source: eslogger' mean?",
        a: "It means the event came from Apple's Endpoint Security framework via the eslogger tool. This is the primary data source on macOS for process, file, and authentication events. It requires sudo and Full Disk Access to run.",

    content: [
      "**How alerts are created** — Every event that arrives at the backend passes through the detection engine. The engine checks the event against all loaded YAML rules. If a rule matches, an alert is created and stored in the database. You are notified in real time via the dashboard.",
      "**Alert details** — Each alert card shows:\n• **Severity badge** — Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Info.\n• **Rule name** — Which detection rule triggered (e.g., \"Suspicious Shell Spawn\", \"Known C2 Port Connection\").\n• **Time** — When the alert was created.\n• **Description** — What happened, in plain language. For example: \"Process nc executed from /tmp/nc\" or \"Outbound connection to 203.0.113.50:4444\".",
      "**Alert lifecycle** — Alerts start as **Open**. You can click the **ACK** (Acknowledge) button to mark them as acknowledged, meaning you've seen them and are aware. Alerts can also be resolved or marked as false positives via the API.",

      "**Two types of detection rules create alerts:**\n• **Single-event rules** — Match one event immediately. Example: a process named \"nmap\" is executed → instant alert.\n• **Threshold rules** — Count matching events over a time window. Example: 5 failed login attempts within 60 seconds → alert fires on the 5th failure.",
    ],
    faqs: [
      {
        q: "I got an alert — what should I do?",
        a: "Read the alert description carefully. Check the rule name to understand what pattern was detected. Then go to the Events page and look at the related events for more context. For example, if you see \"Suspicious Shell Spawn\", check what parent process launched the shell and whether you initiated it yourself.",
      },
      {
        q: "What does 'ACK' mean?",
        a: "ACK stands for Acknowledge. Clicking it tells HomeSOC \"I've seen this alert and I'm aware of it.\" It doesn't resolve the issue — it just moves the alert from 'open' to 'acknowledged' so it doesn't clutter your open alerts list.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I get browser notifications for alerts?",
        a: "Yes! Go to Settings and enable \"Alert Notifications\" under the Notifications section. Your browser will ask for notification permission. Once granted, you'll get desktop pop-ups for high and critical severity alerts.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why am I getting false positive alerts?",
        a: "Detection rules are tuned for general use and may flag legitimate activity. For example, if you use nmap for your own network scanning, the \"Suspicious Recon Tool\" rule will trigger. You can mark alerts as false positives. In the future, rule tuning and whitelisting features will help reduce noise.",

      "**macOS agent** — Uses two collectors:\n• **eslogger** — Apple's Endpoint Security framework. Monitors process executions, file operations, authentication attempts, and signals. This is the most detailed data source. Requires running with `sudo` and the terminal app needs Full Disk Access.\n• **Network (lsof)** — Polls active network connections every 15 seconds. Shows which processes are connecting to which IP addresses and ports.",
      "**Windows agent** — Uses three collectors:\n• **Event Log** — Reads the Windows Security and System event logs for login attempts, privilege use, and system changes.\n• **WMI** — Monitors process creation events in real time via Windows Management Instrumentation.\n• **Netstat** — Polls active network connections and maps them to processes.",
      "**Agent status** — Each agent sends a heartbeat to the backend every 30 seconds. If no heartbeat is received for 60 seconds, the agent is marked offline. The green pulsing dot means online; gray means offline.",
      "**Buffering** — If the backend goes down, agents buffer events locally (up to 100,000 events). When the backend comes back, the agent drains the backlog automatically. No events are lost during temporary outages.",
      "**Removing agents** — Click the X button next to an agent to remove it from the backend. This deletes the agent's registration but does not stop the agent process itself. If the agent is still running, it will re-register on its next heartbeat.",
    ],

      {
        q: "How do I start the macOS agent?",
        a: "Open a terminal and run:\n\n  cd agents/macos\n  sudo python main.py\n\nYou need sudo because eslogger requires root access. Your terminal app also needs Full Disk Access (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access). You can optionally pass --backend-url and --agent-id flags.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does the agent need sudo / root access?",
        a: "On macOS, the eslogger tool accesses the Endpoint Security framework, which is a kernel-level API. Apple restricts this to root processes for security reasons. Without sudo, eslogger won't start and the agent will only collect network data.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if an agent shows as offline?",
        a: "It means the backend hasn't received a heartbeat in the last 60 seconds. Common causes: the agent process crashed or was stopped, the device went to sleep, or there's a network issue between the agent and backend. Check that the agent process is still running.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I run multiple agents on the same machine?",
        a: "Yes, but there's usually no reason to. Each agent generates a unique ID based on hostname + UUID. Running two would produce duplicate events. Use one agent per device.",
      },
      {
        q: "How much bandwidth do agents use?",
        a: "Very little. Events are batched (100 events per batch or every 5 seconds) and sent as compressed JSON over HTTP. On a typical home machine, this is a few kilobytes per batch — negligible on a local network.",

Example: \"Process name is nmap\" → alert.\n• **Threshold** — Counts matching events within a sliding time window. Fires only when the count exceeds the threshold. Example: \"5 failed login attempts within 60 seconds\" → alert on the 5th match.",
      "**Conditions explained:**\n• **category / event_type** — The event must be this category and type (e.g., process + process_exec).\n• **match** — An exact field match. Example: auth_success = false.\n• **match_any** — The field value must be one of the listed values. Example: process_name must be one of [bash, zsh, sh].\n• **not_match** — The field value must NOT be in the list. Used for exclusions. Example: exclude Terminal.app, iTerm2, VSCode from the suspicious shell rule.\n• **match_any_prefix** — The field starts with one of the listed prefixes. Supports wildcards. Example: process_path starts with /tmp/ or /var/tmp/.\n• **not_match_prefix** — The field must NOT start with any listed prefix.\n• **match_any_contains** — The field contains one of the listed substrings.",

    ],
    faqs: [
      {
        q: "Can I write my own detection rules?",
        a: "Yes! Rules are YAML files in the backend/rules/ directory. Create a new .yml file following the format of the existing ones. The backend loads all YAML files from that directory on startup. Restart the backend to pick up new rules.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is a YAML rule file structure?",
        a: "Each file contains a 'rules' array. Each rule has:\n• id — Unique identifier.\n• name — Human-readable name.\n• description — What it detects.\n• severity — info / low / medium / high / critical.\n• type — 'single' or 'threshold'.\n• platform — Which OS (macos, windows, or null for any).\n• conditions — Field matching criteria.\n• window_seconds & threshold — Only for threshold rules.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why did a rule trigger when the activity was legitimate?",
        a: "Rules are generic by design — they flag patterns, not intent. For example, running nmap for your own network audit is legitimate but still matches the \"Suspicious Recon Tool\" rule. Review the alert and acknowledge or mark it as a false positive.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is a C2 port?",
        a: "C2 stands for Command and Control. Malware often communicates with attacker-controlled servers on specific ports like 4444, 1337, 6667, 5555, 9001, 8888, or 31337. If a process on your machine connects to one of these ports on an external IP, it could indicate a compromise. HomeSOC flags this as CRITICAL severity.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is a threshold rule?",
        a: "A threshold rule counts how many times a matching event occurs within a time window. It only fires an alert once the count exceeds the threshold. For example, the brute force rule watches for failed auth events. One failed login is normal (you mistyped your password). Five within 60 seconds suggests an automated attack.",

The collector normalizes it into a NormalizedEvent — a common format with fields for process, file, network, and auth data.\n3. The event is added to the agent's transport buffer.\n4. When the buffer reaches 100 events or 5 seconds elapse, the agent POSTs the batch to the backend's /api/v1/events endpoint.\n5. The backend stores events in SQLite.\n6. The detection engine evaluates each event against all loaded rules.\n7. If a rule matches, an alert is created and stored.\n8. Both events and alerts are broadcast via WebSocket to connected dashboards.\n9. The dashboard updates the Live Feed, Timeline, and Alert Panel in real time.",
      "**The NormalizedEvent** — This is the universal event format. Every collector on every platform converts its raw data into this format. Key fields:\n• id, timestamp, agent_id, platform, category, event_type, severity\n• Process fields: process_name, pid, ppid, path, user, args, hash\n• File fields: file_path, file_action\n• Network fields: src_ip, src_port, dst_ip, dst_port, protocol, dns_query\n• Auth fields: auth_user, auth_method, auth_success\n• raw — The original unmodified data for forensic analysis",
      "**Batching & reliability** — Agents don't send events one at a time. They batch them (100 per batch by default) and send every 5 seconds. If the backend is unreachable, events stay in the local buffer (up to 100,000) and are drained when connectivity returns. This ensures no data loss during backend downtime.",
      "**Detection pipeline** — The detection engine is synchronous and runs inline with ingestion. Every event passes through every rule. This is efficient enough for home-scale traffic (hundreds of events per second). Rules are loaded from YAML files on backend startup.",

        q: "What happens if the backend crashes?",
